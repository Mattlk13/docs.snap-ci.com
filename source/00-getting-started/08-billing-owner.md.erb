## Who should be the billing owner of our pipelines?

As seen in the <a href="https://docs.snap-ci.com/managing-your-github-connection/managing-membership/">managing membership section</a> of this documentation, the billing owner is the owner of repository/organization on GitHub and owns the paid or trial account on Snap. Whoever adds the repo to Snap and creates the pipeline becomes that pipeline's owner, so you want the team member with the paid Snap subscription to own all of the team's pipelines.

Some teams are fine with one team member being the billing owner, but other teams want all team members to be have the ability to add private repos to Snap, repair Github connectivity, and make changes to the billing subscription. For these teams, we recommend creating a shared user within Github and <a href="https://staging-docs.snap-ci.com/managing-your-github-connection/managing-membership/#to-perform-a-sync%23transfer-billing-ownership-of-repository">transferring all Snap pipelines</a> to said user. That way you can share the credentials for the shared user within your team, and any team member can log into Snap as the billing owner.

If you need help transferring your pipelines to a single billing owner or have any other questions, please [get in touch with us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>).
